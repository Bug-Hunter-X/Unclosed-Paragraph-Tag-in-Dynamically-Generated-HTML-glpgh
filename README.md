# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in Dynamically Generated HTML
This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error involving an unclosed paragraph tag within dynamically generated content using JavaScript's innerHTML.  The error isn't immediately obvious but can lead to rendering inconsistencies and validation issues.

## Bug Description:
The `bug.html` file showcases the issue.  JavaScript dynamically inserts a paragraph tag into a div, but the closing tag is missing from the inserted HTML string.

## Solution:
The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected code.  The missing closing </p> tag is added to the dynamically inserted HTML string, resolving the issue.

## How to Reproduce the Bug:
1. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
2. Observe that the dynamic content is likely displayed correctly but the HTML validation may fail because of missing closing tag.

## How to fix the Bug:
1. Open `bugSolution.html` in your web browser.
2. Observe the correct rendering of the content without any validation errors.
